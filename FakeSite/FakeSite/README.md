## Video Section

For the video section of the site, use the API source. You do not have to build a video player, but you can open the link to Vimeo itself.

For every item in this json file, render the video section. Use the thumbnail that is provided in the API response if you can.

Vimeo Videos api (or use videos.json in the zip):

```
https://vimeo.com/api/v2/channel/staffpicks/videos.json
```
